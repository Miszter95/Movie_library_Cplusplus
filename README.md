# Movie_library_C++

I have created a system for recording movies. I store the titles, play times, release years, and IMDb ratings of movies. There is an age limit for family movies, and I store a text description for documentaries.

I read the movies into the program from a text file. You can search for movies (by title, release year, play times, etc.) and print them out to another text file (copied). You can also sort the movies by (title, release year, play times, etc.). You can also add members in the program itself (now: documentary, family movie). The parent class is Movies, which currently has two children, Family Movies and Documentary Movies. The Movie Library creates a library that stores data about different types of movies.

This project was created using CodeBlocks.
